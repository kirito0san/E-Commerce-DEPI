        Hi there! I'm hager, the heart behind GiftLove, where every package is a
        thoughtful gesture wrapped with care.
      </h2>

      <p>
        It all began with a simple idea: making it easy for people to share love
        and connection, no matter how far apart they are. Whether it's a
        birthday, celebration, or just a little reminder that someone cares,
        GiftLove is here to help you send joy in the form of beautiful, curated
        gift boxes. Our mission is simple — to help you turn moments into
        memories by delivering a little bit of happiness to your loved ones'
        doorstep. Each box is handpicked and packed with love, designed to bring
        smiles and warmth, even when you're miles away.

        We love helping our customers send <br />
        all the warmth and comfort of a hug <br />
        from afar.

        When you order a ‘hug in a box’ gift hamper, you can add extra personal
        touches such as your own message. Every BearHugs gift box is hand-packed
        with love and then popped in the post so it can be sent directly to a
        doorstep of your loved one.  We’re really proud of our signature 'hug'
        gift boxes which reveal outstretched paws and a ‘Consider this a
        BearHug’ message on opening. They never fail to make us smile and we
        love hearing that they’ve made recipients smile too.
